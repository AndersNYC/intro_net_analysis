# README.md

This workshop was created based on some resources available online. I've linked them all on the Resources section CREATE A LINK HERE. I strongly suggest that you read those after this workshop to advance your knowledge on network analysis with Python. I want to make a special mention to the excellent blog [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/exploring-and-analyzing-network-data-with-python) from which I borrowed many examples and explanations. 

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Understand basic concepts of Network Analysis
- Understand how to create network graphs with the NetworkX libray
- Learn how to add nodes, edges and metadata
- Learn network analysis tools
- Learn how to plot network graphs
- Learn how to import networks from files
